# âš™ pedrosanta / dotfiles
My collection of configuration and dotfiles, mostly set to work with **macOS**, **bash** shell and native **Terminal.app**, so if your preferences differ you may need to adjust further.

It makes use of [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), a very simple and interesting symlink tool [particularly useful to help manage dotfiles repositories](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

## Installation

Installing these dotfiles and bootstrapping a new Mac is simple, just follow the next steps.

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

Clone the repository to `~/.dotfiles` folder, like so.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:pedrosanta/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Finally, run the `bootstrap.sh` to set initial config/defaults, install Homebrew packages/apps and set up the dotfiles:

```shell
./bootstrap.sh
```

### Update and usage

The before mentioned `bootstrap.sh` is best suited to bootstrap new systems. If you happen to pull updates to your dotfiles, or update your desired Homebrew packages/apps, you can run the scripts in separate:

- Run `./brew.sh` if you have updated the package or apps list, you can also use this script to update and upgrade installed formulae;
- Run `./install.sh` to re-install/re-symlink dotfiles, for instance, in the case you've pulled new dotfiles that need to be symlinked;
