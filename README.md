# âš™ pedrosanta / dotfiles
My collection of configuration and dotfiles, based on [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) repository.

## Installation

Clone the repository to wherever you want.

```
git clone git@github.com:pedrosanta/dotfiles.git
```

Much like the abovementioned project, to setup/install the dotfiles `cd` into your `dotfiles` repository and run:

```
source bootstrap.sh
```

### Update and usage

When you need to update the dotfiles, **update them on the repository** and run the script again, since it will overwrite the files on your home folder and ignore any changes you've made to them.

```
source bootstrap.sh
```
